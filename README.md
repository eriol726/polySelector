# polySelector
Maya plugin that selects an area  of polygons from target polygons  

## Issue
Scanned (photogrammetry) 3d models is not fun to model, so-called Non-manifold meshes. The polygons are not necessarily connected, edges lacks of connected faces and the shortest edge path algorithm will not cover very long distances. Therefore, you will encounter difficulties in selecting desired parts from your mesh. 
But you're in luck. Meshlab has a fantastic tool to simplify and reconstruct your mesh to be able to edit it more easily in a modeling software. With that done you can use my polyselector python plugin to extract a component/part/building from the mesh.

## Instructions:

* First of all, start by importing the scanned mesh into Meshlab, select filters, Reconstruction, simplification and reconstruction. Select Surface Reconstruction: Ball Pivoting. Increase the world unit by clicking the up arrow on time (225.09) and Apply. (the process will not destroy the mesh's uv coordinates).

* Export your reconstructed mesh and import it into Maya.

* Use the Multi-cut tool to cut out the part of the mesh you want to extract (this tool works best for manifold meshes).

* Mark the edges that have cut out of your part so that it is "circled".

* Click Multi-component so you can also select a center polygon, select a polygon in the center of your area.

* Read the python script, type run() in the terminal and click execute.

* Now all polygons are marked in the area

* Select extract in edit Mesh and now your part is separated from the mesh
